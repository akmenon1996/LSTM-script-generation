Project has been worked on by Abhijit Krishna Menon as a part of the Udacity Nano Degree in Deep Learning. 

Find the notebook and the HTML file for the same in the repository. 

If you want to load the model to run, you will need to access a GPU/ use torch.load('model.pt',map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
